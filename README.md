## Introduction

The **Perception Models** repository provides a collection of cutting-edge models designed for image and video processing. These models leverage the latest advancements in machine learning to improve the understanding of visual and textual data. Whether you are a researcher, developer, or enthusiast, this repository has something for you.

## Features

- **CLIP Models**: Utilize the power of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) to connect images and text.
- **Multimodal Language Models**: Explore models that can understand and generate text based on visual inputs.
- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Achieve high accuracy and efficiency in various perception tasks.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple APIs for quick integration into your projects.

## Installation

To get started, you need to clone this repository. Run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Unlustiger121/perception_models.git
cd perception_models
```

Next, install the required dependencies. You can use pip for this:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Once you have installed the repository, you can start using the models. Here is a basic example of how to use a CLIP model:

```python
from models import CLIPModel

model = CLIPModel()
image = "path/to/image.jpg"
text = "A description of the image"

similarity = model.calculate_similarity(image, text)
print(f"Similarity score: {similarity}")
```
